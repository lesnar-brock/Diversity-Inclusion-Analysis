# PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Case Experience
## Diversity & Inclusion Analysis with Business Report

### Overview
This project, completed as part of the PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Case Experience on Forage, delivers a comprehensive analysis of diversity and inclusion metrics for a telecom client named PhoneNow. The analysis focuses on addressing gender balance challenges in executive management through data-driven insights and visualization.

What sets this project apart is the combination of an interactive Power BI dashboard with a detailed 14-page business report.
